// What I fixed:
// (1)â€“(4) Each input was being stored into "one". Changed them so values go into one, two, three, and four properly.
// (5) Changed condition for two from OR (||) to AND (&&) so it compares correctly against all numbers.
// (6) Removed unnecessary "== one" in the three check. It should only compare if three is greater than the others.
