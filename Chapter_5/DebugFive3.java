// What I fixed:
// (1) The first condition should check if the item number is less than LOW, not greater.
// (2) There was a typo in the second condition where HIGH was misspelled as HIGHH.
// (3) The third condition should check if the item number is less than CUTOFF to classify it as Automotive, not equal.
// (4) The last else now correctly handles all numbers 500 or more, which belong to the Housewares Department.
